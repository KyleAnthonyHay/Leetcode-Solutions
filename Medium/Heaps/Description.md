## Solution

```py
def generateDocument(characters, document):
    chars = {}

    # Count Character Occourences in characters
    for char in characters:
        if char not in chars:
            chars[char] = 1
        else:
            chars[char] += 1
    # Subtract Character Occourences from characters
    for char in document:
        if char not in chars or chars[char] == 0:
            return False
        else:
            chars[char] -= 1

    return True
```

## Explanation

**Time: O(n) For _building_ the `heap`** <br/>
**Space: O(1) since all operations are done in place**<br/>

1. Create a dictionary, `chars`, to store the number of character occurences in the `characters` string.

```py
chars = {}
```

The plan is to iterate through the input string `character`. At each point, we count how many times we see each character in the string. If we see a character for the first time, then we initialize the count as 1: `chars[char] = 1`, otherwise we increment the count by one: `chars[char] += 1`.

```py
for char in characters:
    if char not in chars:
        chars[char] = 1
    else:
        chars[char] += 1
```

2. Now, we iterate through the document string. At each point, we check if the currently observed character `char` exists in the dictionary. If it does, we decrement the count by one: `chars[char] -= 1`. If it doesn't exist, then we return `False`.

We also check if the count is 0. This is because the count = 0 indicates that we have used up all the avaliable character of that type. To illustate this, let's say we have two input strings:

```py
characters = "aabb"
document = "aabbb" # This string cannot be generated by "characters"
```

After the first for loop terminates, char["b"] = 2. And in the second for loop, when the index approaches the first two b's in the `document` string, char["b"] will be decremented by 1 two times. By the third time: `chars[char] == 0` would return True.

```py
    for char in document:
        if char not in chars or chars[char] == 0:
            return False
        else:
            chars[char] -= 1
```

Finally, if we have reached the end of the second for loop without terminating, we know we can generate the string in the `document` using the chars in `characters`

```py
return True
```

And we're **Done**!
